# Seamless Learning

UC Berkeley software projects for teaching large courses. 

The **Seamless Learning** project proposes an open-source, light-weight, and sustainable suite of tools to integrate Research, Teaching & Learning (RTL) and custom course tool platforms. Today, there is a suite of custom course tools used primarily by EECS, Data Science, Statisticsâ€”the three undergraduate programs in the new College of Computing, Data, and Society (CDSS). Collectively, each year these dozens of tools are jointly developed by hundreds of Teaching Assistants (TAs) and reach thousands of students in a variety of courses. While custom course tools have proven their utility, we must support instructors and TAs across campus who are also managing high enrollments.

Overall project goals:
* Improve large classroom management,
* Enable equitable grading strategies, and
* Foster an educational technology community across campus. We're all here to teach and learn!

## Announcements

* **December 2024**: We held our singular Tools Lunch this semester. Fall 2024 TAs and teaching faculty from 9 different courses presented lightning talks and cool demos of discussion/grading management, autograders, teaching visualizations, accessible features, exam writing, and much more. We also heard some broader campus Learning Tools updates from the LET Service Lead, Lisha Bornilla.
  * Check out the meeting's [Tools Lunch slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bKdM0Kw7eHNIF8I4-9-CwXZAd6IyoT0Bua-DA9MONg4/edit?usp=drive_link)! (requires UC Berkeley log-in)
  * If you are interested in forming an Ed Discussion Community of Practice, piloting Peerceptiv, or using discussion checkpoints on bCourses, please check out the slidedeck above for email contacts!

* **August 2024**: We held our Accessibility Workshop. TAs, past and present, explored options for creating digital accessible content. This workshop was held in collaboration with CoE Accessibility and other course staff.
  * Access the [workshop page]({{site.base_url}}a11y-workshop) for more information and resources.
  * Over 20 TAs across EECS and Data Science contributed to our [a11y Course Resource Document]({{site.base_url}}a11y)! Check out this document to implement accessibility (a11y) on your own public course resources.
  * We also have a Berkeley Class Template ([GitHub](https://github.com/berkeley-cdss/berkeley-class-site)), a template heavily adapted from Just the Class (already used by many of our courses) that meets online web accessibility standards. Please check it out below, and consider migrating your course website to the Seamless Learning website template!

* **June 2024**: We held our inaugural Seamless Learning Student Assistant Workshop. Students had a week to create some pretty cool projects, and we hosted some awesome talks thanks to the Research, Teaching, and Learning Services staff team.

### Seamless Learning Tools Lunches

We run a monthly lunch for EECS, Data Science, and Statistics TAs and instructors to share their cool classroom technologies. The inaugural set of these lunches in AY23-24 was awesome. We covered everything from Gradescope, EdStem, and DataHub to super-customized course tools for gradebooks, office hours queues...you name it!
